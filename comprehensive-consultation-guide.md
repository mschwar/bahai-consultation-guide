# Comprehensive Guide to Baha'i Consultation

### Consultation

>_"The Heaven of divine wisdom is illumined with the two luminaries of consultation and compassion. Take ye counsel together in all matters, inasmuch as consultation is the lamp of guidance which leadeth the way, and is the bestower of understanding." (Tablets of Bahá'u'lláh, p. 168)_

>_“In all things it is necessary to consult. This matter should be forcibly stressed by thee, so that consultation may be observed by all.  The intent of what hath been revealed from the Pen of the Most High is that consultation may be fully carried out among the friends, inasmuch as it is and will always be a cause of awareness and of awakening and a source of good and well-being.” ···Bahá'u'lláh, Consultation:  a Compilation, p. 3. also in Compilation of Compilations Vol. I, p. 93.

>“_...When a difficulty is brought out into the daylight and freely discussed by a duly authorized and responsible group of people who are sincerely desirous of finding the best solution and are free from prejudice or personal motive, then there is a good chance of overcoming it" On behalf of Shoghi Effendi, Lights of Guidance, p.89.**

>_"Consultation bestoweth greater awareness and transmuteth conjecture into certitude. It is a shining light which, in a dark world, leadeth the way and guideth." - 'Abdu'l-Baha_

>“Consultation bestoweth greater awareness and transmuteth conjecture into certitude.”  ···Bahá'u'lláh, Consultation:  a Compilation, p. 3. also in Compilation of Compilations Vol. I, p. 93

>_“When a believer has a problem concerning which he must make a decision, he has several courses open to him. If it is a matter that affects the interests of the Faith he should consult with the appropriate Assembly or committee, but individuals have many problems which are purely personal and there is no obligation upon them to take such problems to the institutions of the Faith; indeed, when the needs of the teaching work are of such urgency it is better if the friends will not burden their Assemblies with personal problems that they can solve by themselves.
“A Bahá'í who has a problem may wish to make his own decision upon it after prayer and after weighing all the aspects of it in his own mind; he may prefer to seek the counsel of individual friends or of professional counselors such as his doctor or lawyer so that he can consider such advice when making his decision; or in a case where several people are involved, such as a family situation, he may want to gather together those who are affected so that they may arrive at a collective decision. There is also no objection whatever to a Bahá'í asking a group of people to consult together on a problem facing him.
“It should be borne in mind that all consultation is aimed at arriving at a solution to a problem and is quite different from the sort of group baring of the soul that is popular in some circles these days and which borders on the kind of confession that is forbidden in the faith. On the subject of confession the Guardian's secretary wrote on his behalf to an individual believer:
'We are forbidden to confess to any person, as do the Catholics to their priests, our sins and shortcomings, or to do so in public, as some religious sects do. However, if we spontaneously desire to acknowledge we have been wrong in something, or that we have some fault of character, and ask another person's forgiveness or pardon, we are quite free to do so. The Guardian wants to point out, however, that we are not obliged to do so. It rests entirely with the individual.'” ···The Universal House of Justice, Consultation: a Compilation, p. 23. also in The Compilation of Compilations Vol. I, p. 109.

**First Principles**

>1. “But, O my brother, when a true seeker determines to take the step of search in the path leading to the knowledge of the Ancient of Days, he must, before all else, cleanse and purify his heart, which is the seat of the revelation of the inner mysteries of God, from the obscuring dust of all acquired knowledge...” (Bahá'u'lláh, Kitáb-i-Íqán  p.192)
>2. “The other point is that the primary challenge in dealing with issues of peace is to raise the context to the level of principle, as distinct from pure pragmatism.  For, in essence, peace stems from an inner state supported by a spiritual or moral attitude, and it is chiefly in evoking this attitude that the possibility of enduring solutions can be found.  There are spiritual principles, or what some call human values, by which solutions can be found for every social problem.  Any well-intentioned group can in a general sense devise practical solutions to its problems, but good intentions and practical knowledge are usually not enough.  The essential merit of spiritual principle is that it not only presents a perspective which harmonizes with that which is immanent in human nature, it also induces an attitude, a dynamic, a will, an aspiration, which facilitates the discovery and implementation of practical measures.  Leaders of governments and all in authority would be well served in their efforts to solve problems if they would first seek to identify the principles involved and then be guided by them.” (Universal House of Justice, The Promise of World Peace   )   
>3. “To deepen in the Cause means to read the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh and the Master so thoroughly as to be able to give it to others in its pure form. There are many who have some superficial idea of what the Cause stands for.  They, therefore, present it together with all sorts of ideas that are their own.  As the Cause is still in its early days we must be most careful lest we fall under this error and injure the Movement we so much adore.” (From a letter written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer,  August 25, 1926,  Lights of Guidance Page 565: )    
>4. “The root cause of wrongdoing is ignorance, and we must therefore hold fast to the tools of perception and knowledge.  Good character must be taught.  Light must be spread afar, so that, in the school of humanity, all may acquire the heavenly characteristics of the spirit, and see for themselves beyond any doubt that there is no fiercer Hell, no more fiery abyss, than to possess a character that is evil and unsound; no more darksome pit nor loathsome torment than to show forth qualities which deserve to be condemned. The individual must be educated to such a high degree that he would rather have his throat cut than tell a lie, and would think it easier to be slashed with a sword or pierced with a spear than to utter calumny or be carried away by wrath.  Thus will be kindled the sense of human dignity and pride, to burn away the reapings of lustful appetites.  Then will each one of God’s beloved shine out as a bright moon with qualities of the spirit, and the relationship of each to the Sacred Threshold of his Lord will be not illusory but sound and real, will be as the very foundation of the building, not some embellishment on its facade.”  (‘Abdu’l-Bahá Selections from the Writings of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá  p. 136. also in Compilation of Compilations I  p. 263-264: )**

**The first condition is absolute love and harmony**

>_"The first condition is absolute love and harmony...." ('Abdu'l-Bahá, Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Bahá, p. 88)_

**In the atmosphere of love**

>_“. . . Therefore true consultation is spiritual conference in the attitude and atmosphere of love. Members must love each other in the spirit of fellowship in order that good results may be forthcoming.  Love and fellowship are the foundation.” ···'Abdu'l-Bahá, in The Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 72

**Requires purity of motive, radiance of spirit, detachment from all save God

>_“The prime requisites for them that take counsel together are:
purity of motive,
radiance of spirit,
detachment from all else save God, 
attraction to His Divine Fragrances,
humility and lowliness amongst His loved ones,
patience and long-suffering in difficulties
and servitude to His exalted Threshold.
“Should they be graciously aided to acquire these attributes, victory from the unseen kingdom of Bahá shall be vouchsafed to them… . The members thereof must take counsel together in such wise that no occasion for ill-feeling or discord may arise. This can be attained when every member expresseth with absolute freedom his own opinion and setteth forth his argument. Should any one oppose, he must on no account feel hurt for not until matters are fully discussed can the right way be revealed.” ···'Abdu'l-Bahá, quoted in the Guardian's letter dated 5 March 1922 to the Friends in America, Bahá'í Administration, p. 21,  also:  Consultation: a Compilation, p. 5.(emphasis added)

**Absolute Freedom of Expression

>_"Bahá’í consultation is not an easy process. It requires love, kindliness, moral courage and humility. Thus no member should ever allow himself to be prevented from expressing frankly his view because it may offend a fellow member; and realizing this, no member should take offense at another member’s statements." from a letter of the Universal House of Justice to the National Spiritual Assembly of Italy, August 26 1965, Lights of Guidance p. 180_

>_"The members thereof must take counsel together in such wise that no occasion for ill-feeling or discord may arise. This can be attained when every member expresseth with absolute freedom his own opinion and setteth forth his argument." ('Abdu'l-Bahá, Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Bahá, p. 87)_

>_"The shining spark of truth cometh forth only after the clash of differing opinions." ('Abdu'l-Bahá, Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Bahá, p. 87)_

**Views expressed with utmost devotion, courtesy, dignity, care, and moderation

>_"They must then proceed with the utmost devotion, courtesy, dignity, care and moderation to express their views." - 'Abdu'l-Bahá, Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Bahá, p. 87)

**Concentrated on the investigation of truth

>"...all the deliberations must be concentrated on the investigation of truth." ('Abdu'l-Bahá, The Divine Art of Living, p. 86)

**And not insist upon their own opinion

>_"They must in every matter search out the truth and not insist upon their own opinion, for stubbornness and persistence in one's views will lead ultimately to discord and wrangling and the truth will remain hidden." ('Abdu'l-Bahá, Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Bahá, p. 88)_

**Loose thy soul from the prison of self

>“O MY SERVANT! Free thyself from the fetters of this world, and loose thy soul from the prison of self. Seize thy chance, for it will come to thee no more.” 9_

>When one is released from the prison of self, that is indeed freedom!  For self is the greatest prison.  When this release takes place one can never be imprisoned. 
“Unless one accepts dire vicissitudes*, not with dull resignation, but with radiant acquiescence*, one cannot attain this freedom.” ···'Abdu'l-Bahá, The Divine Art of Living, p. 70. (1965 ed.)

**Satan is the insistent self

>“‘Abdu’l-Bahá was once asked,’What is Satan?’ He replied in three words: ‘The insistent self.’ ” 2---?‘Abdu’l-Bahá, The Promulgation of Universal Peace, 15 June 1912, [4], p. 190 

**Self is the worst of all human characteristics

 >Bahá’u’lláh denounced self and passion as “the worst of all human characteristics” 7 
 “The lowliest and most abject of all things holdeth sway over thee, and that is none other than self and passion, which have ever been reprehensible.” 8 (Tablet addressed to Ali Pasha, the Grand Vizir of Turkey who was responsible for His exile to Akka: _)

>“When a reporter of the New York Globe visited ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in Haifa, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá gave him this message, ‘Tell my followers that they have no enemies to fear, no foes to hate. Man’s only enemy is himself’. 4  

**Material ideas and worldly thought attract man to the centre of self

>“Just as the earth attracts everything to the centre of gravity, and every object thrown upward into space will come down, so also material ideas and worldly thought attract man to the centre of self.  Anger, passion, ignorance, prejudice, greed, envy, covetousness, jealousy and suspicion prevent man from ascending to the realms of holiness, imprisoning him in the claws of self and the cage of egotism.  The physical man, unassisted by the divine power, trying to escape from one of these invisible enemies, will unconsciously fall into the hands of another.  No sooner does he attempt to soar upward than the density of the love of self, like the power of gravity, draws him to the centre of the earth.  The only power that is capable of delivering man from this captivity is the power of the breaths of the Holy Spirit.” ···'Abdu'l-Bahá, Bahá’í Scriptures p. 546 also quoted in Bahá'í Readings, p. 305 (January 6).

**Do not quarrel with anybody, and shun every form of dispute.

>“Do not quarrel with anybody, and shun every form of dispute. Utter the Word of God.  If he accepteth it the desired purpose is attained, and if he turneth away leave him to himself and trust to God.  Such is the attribute of those who are firm in the Covenant.” ··'Abdu'l-Bahá, Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Bahá, p. 210.**

**Conflicts and disputes are not allowable, not even with Satan himself

>“Remember how Adam and the others once dwelt together in Eden.  No sooner, however, did a quarrel break out between Adam and Satan than they were, one and all, banished from the Garden, and this was meant as a warning to the human race, a means of telling humankind that dissension--even with the Devil—is the way to bitter loss.  This is why, in our illumined age, God teacheth that conflicts and disputes are not allowable, not even with Satan himself.” ···'Abdu'l-Bahá, Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Bahá, p. 275.

**Pity on those who in the right or wrong are the cause of discord.  

>“Blessed are they who are the means of making unity among the friends, and pity on those who in the right or wrong are the cause of discord.  For instance:  when one is in the right in a case in dispute, and his minority prevents him from establishing this rightful matter, instead of agitating the subject, if he will humbly submit to sacrifice his position for the sake of unity and peace, God will accept that sacrifice and ere long the rightful matter will be established without any further dispute, by the Divine assistance; whereas without such sacrifice and submissiveness great harm might ensue.  The friends must be prepared to efface themselves at all times.  Seeking the approval of men is many times the cause of imperiling the approval of God.” ···'Abdu'l-Bahá, in Star of the West, Vol. 6, no. 6, p. 45.

**The Baha'i cause is the very essence of love

>“...the Cause of the Ancient Beauty is the very essence of love,...existing only that all may...
become servants one to another,
adore one another, 
bless one another, 
praise one another; 
that each one may loose his tongue and extol the rest without exception,
each one voice his gratitude to all the rest; 
that all should lift up their eyes to the horizon of glory, and remember that they are
                linked to the Holy Threshold; 
that they should see nothing but good in one another, 
hear nothing but praise of one another, 
and speak no word of one another save only to praise.” ···'Abdu'l-Bahá, Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Bahá, p. 229-230.

**Failure to attain cordial unity is a failure of the main purpose for which the Báb, Bahá'u'lláh and the Beloved Master lived and suffered. 

>“If we Bahá’ís cannot attain to cordial unity among ourselves, then we fail to realize the main purpose for which the Báb, Bahá'u'lláh and the Beloved Master lived and suffered. 
“In order to achieve this cordial unity one of the first essentials insisted on by Bahá'u'lláh and 'Abdu'l-Bahá is that we resist the natural tendency to let our attention dwell on the faults and failings of others rather than on our own. Each of us is responsible for one life only, and that is our own. Each of us is immeasurably far from being “perfect as our heavenly father is perfect” and the task of perfecting our own life and character is one that requires all our attention, our will-power and energy.  If we allow our attention and energy to be taken up in efforts to keep others right and remedy their faults, we are wasting precious time.  We are like ploughmen each of whom has his team to manage and his plough to direct, and in order to keep his furrow straight he must keep his eye on his goal and concentrate on his own task.  If he looks to this side and that to see how Tom and Harry are getting on and to criticize their ploughing, then his own furrow will assuredly become crooked. ···(From a letter dated 12 May 1925 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer) Living the Life:   a Compilation, p. 10 (British Publishing Trust) also in Compilation of Compilations vol. II p. 3-4.

**See in every human only that which is worthy of praise

>“One must see in every human being only that which is worthy of praise.  When this is done, one can be a friend to the whole human race. If, however, we look at people from the standpoint of their faults, then being a friend to them is a formidable task.” ···'Abdu'l-Bahá: ,  Selections from  the Writings of ‘Abdu'l-Bahá, p. 169.

**Let not your heart be offended with anyone

>“Act in such a way that your heart may be free from hatred.  Let not your heart be offended with anyone.  If someone commits an error and wrong toward you, you must instantly forgive him.  Do not complain of others.  Refrain from reprimanding them, and if you wish to give admonition or advice, let it be offered in such a way that it will not burden the bearer.  Turn all your thoughts toward bringing joy to hearts.  Beware!  Beware!  lest ye offend any heart.” ··· ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Promulgation of Universal Peace p. 453.

**Decide/Vote

>"...all matters without exception must be put to the vote." (Shoghi Effendi, Lights of Guidance, p. 47)

**Work towards consensus. Accept majority decisions. 

>"Should unanimity be impossible, a majority decision shall prevail." (Shoghi Effendi, Bahá'í Administration, p. 21)

**Implement decisions with unity. Support the outcome. 

>"...when the majority has voted on a matter, all... are duty bound to accept and obey it." (On behalf of Shoghi Effendi, Lights of Guidance, p. 48)

>"When a decision has been reached it is incumbent on all to act on it with unity. There can be no more thrashing around of ideas; the decision must be supported wholeheartedly." (On behalf of the Universal House of Justice, 1989 Feb 02, Compilation on Consultation)

**Worst case

>"...should harmony of thought and absolute unity be non-existent, that gathering shall be dispersed and that assembly be brought to naught." ('Abdu'l-Bahá, Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Bahá, p. 88)



## Key Attitudes & Spiritual Preparation (Before & During)

*   **Prayer & Reflection:** Begin with prayer. Ask for guidance, humility, and detachment.
*   **Detachment from Opinion:** Share your thoughts as contributions, not fixed positions. Be willing to have your idea improved or superseded.
*   **Love & Unity:** Strive for a loving, respectful atmosphere. The goal is unity, not "winning" an argument.
*   **Humility:** Recognize that truth can emerge from any soul.
*   **Truthfulness & Frankness (with Courtesy):** Speak your mind openly and honestly, but always with kindness and respect for others.
*   **Attentive Listening:** Truly listen to understand, without interrupting. Give full attention to each speaker.
*   **Focus on Principles, Not Personalities:** Discuss the merits of ideas, not the people presenting them. Avoid criticism of individuals.


---

## The Consultation Process – In Brief

1.  **Spiritual Opening:** Start with prayers to set a spiritual tone.
2.  **Clarify the Topic/Question:** Define the topic. Ensure everyone understands what is being consulted upon.
    *   _What is the core issue? What are we trying to achieve?_
3.  **Gather Facts & Perspectives:**
    *   Share all relevant information, Baha'i guidance, and known facts.
    *   **All participants should be encouraged to share their views freely.**
4.  **Explore & Weigh Ideas:**
    *   Discuss different viewpoints and suggestions thoroughly.
    *   Examine proposals in light of spiritual principles, facts, and the common good.
    *  _What are the pros and cons? What are the implications?_
    * Listen carefully to others' views. Strive for understanding.
5.  **Strive for Unanimity:** The ideal outcome is a decision everyone feels is the best way forward. Build on ideas. Work towards consensus.
6.  **Reaching a Decision:**
    *   If unanimity is reached, this is the decision.
    *   If not, vote.
7.  **Wholehearted Support:** Once a decision is made (unanimous or majority), all participants should accept and support it fully and enthusiastically, as if it were their own original idea. Implement decisions with love and unity.

Some additional relevant subjects:


**On no subject are the Bahá'í teachings more emphatic than a) the necessity to abstain from faultfinding and backbiting

>“On no subject are the Bahá'í teachings more emphatic than on the necessity to abstain from faultfinding and backbiting while being ever eager to discover and root out our own faults and overcome our own failings. 
>“If we profess loyalty to Bahá'u'lláh, to our Beloved Master and our dear Guardian, then we must show our love by obedience to these explicit teachings.  Deeds not words are what they demand, and no amount of fervour in the use of expressions of loyalty and adulation will compensate for failure to live in the spirit of the teachings.” ···(From a letter dated 12 May 1925 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer) Living the Life:   a Compilation, p. 10 (British Publishing Trust) also in Compilation of Compilations vol.

II p. 3-4.

**Think of your own faults

>“He ('Abdu'l-Bahá) was asked, ‘How shall I overcome seeing the faults of others – recognizing the wrong in others?’, and He replied: ‘I will tell you.  Whenever you recognize the fault of another, think of yourself!  What are my imperfections? and try to remove them.  Do this whenever you are tried through the words or deeds of others.  Thus you will grow, become more perfect.  You will overcome self, you will not even have time to think of the faults of others...’ ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Selections from the Writings of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, p.230-231.

**Backbiting is divisive, it is the leading cause among the friends of a disposition to withdraw. 

>“O beloved of the Lord!  If any soul speak ill of an absent one, the only result will clearly be this:  he will dampen the zeal of the friends and tend to make them indifferent.  For backbiting is divisive, it is the leading cause among the friends of a disposition to withdraw.  If any individual should speak ill of one who is absent, it is incumbent on his hearers, in a spiritual and friendly manner, to stop him, and say in effect:  would this detraction serve any useful purpose?  Would it please the Blessed Beauty, contribute to the lasting honour of the friends, promote the holy Faith, support the Covenant, or be of any possible benefit to any soul?  No, Never!  On the contrary, it would make the dust to settle so thickly on the heart that the ears would hear no more, and the eyes would no longer behold the light of truth. 
If, however, a person setteth about speaking well of another, opening his lips to praise another, he will touch an answering chord in his hearers and they will be stirred up by the breathings of God...” ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Selections from the Writings of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, p.230-231.

**Discussions of the faults of others most fertile cause of disunity

>“...When a difficulty is brought out into the daylight and freely discussed by a duly authorized and responsible group of people who are sincerely desirous of finding the best solution and are free from prejudice or personal motive, then there is a good chance of overcoming it, but discussions of the faults of others, behind their backs by unauthorized people who have no authority to take action in the matter, is surely one of the most fertile causes–probably THE most fertile cause– of disunity, and the importance of putting an end to this practice should be impressed on all Bahá’ís.” · ·On behalf of Shoghi Effendi, Lights of Guidance, p.89.**
